#Write a program that asks for three numbers, calculates the average, and displays the result, properly labeled. Note that the numbers can have decimals, #so you will need to use to_f instead of to_i.Sample output:
number_1 = ""
number_2 = ""
number_3 = ""

print "Enter first number:"
gets.number_1.to_f
print "Enter second number:"
gets.number_2.to_f
print "Enter third number:"
gets.number_3.to_f

# average = number_1 + number_2 + number_3
# print "Average is: #{average}"

puts number_2
